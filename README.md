The final result is the sub.csv, it contains two columns, the first one is the `customer id`, the second one is the `predicted service type the customer will choose`.

The stacking_model.ipynb is the file to define the different features used in the final model. The outcome of this file is two new csv files. One is the new `train.csv`, the other one is the new `test.csv`. These two files will be used in model.ipynb to get the final result which is the sub.csv.

Then use the F1-score to evaluate this model, which is 0.838.
